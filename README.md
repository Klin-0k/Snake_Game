## About: 
This is the snake game that has two modes in current time: classic mode and upgrade classic mode.
Classic mode is classic snake game in which you should eat food to grow up and get score. Aim of the game is to get as much score as possible.
Upgraded Classic mode has the same aim of the game, but there are bonuses that can help or interfere you to play it: 
1) syringe - bonus that makes snake two times faster then it was and gives you two score points
2) tablet - bonus that makes snake two times slower then it was
3) knife - bonus that takes out half of your scores and make snake two times short then it was.

All games results are recording and saving in Resources/Records.txt file, but in current time you can't watch them from the game 

Also the game has settings in which you can change snake style, field style and field size

Navigation in game menus is done using the mouse. The snake is controlled using the wasd or arrows
